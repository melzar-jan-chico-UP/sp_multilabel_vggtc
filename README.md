# Multi-label Video Game Genre Text Classification: A BERT-based Approach

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract
>Video games are getting more popular and accessible than ever, with their demands and technologies increasing every day. This continued rise also mirrors to the rising amount of video games as well, which could become a daunting task in terms of classification. Genres are commonly used to classify video games, which can be challenging given its extensive and dynamic nature. Furthermore, video games are not limited to a single genre alone, it can have multiple genres as well. Because of these reasons, there is a necessity for a video game genre multi-label classification system. This study aims to solve that exact problem with video game text summary descriptions as the main feature and shall utilize natural language processes (NLP) processes and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) framework as its methods. The final output shall be a video game genre classification model that will be beneficial for both in research and in the video game industry.
